# **DiseasePredictor**

## **Overview**  
This machine learning system predicts diseases based on user-reported symptoms. Using a **Random Forest classifier** trained on symptom-disease relationships, it provides quick preliminary diagnoses. The system handles **data preprocessing**, **feature encoding**, and **model training** automatically.

## **Key Features**
- ðŸ©º **Symptom-based disease prediction**
- ðŸ§  **Random Forest machine learning model**
- ðŸ§¹ **Automatic data cleaning (handles missing values)**
- ðŸ“‹ **Symptom vocabulary access**
- ðŸ§ª **Built-in validation (20% test set)**
- ðŸ”„ **Consistent feature encoding**
